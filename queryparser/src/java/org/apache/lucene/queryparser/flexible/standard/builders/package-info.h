 * <h2>Standard Lucene Query Node Builders</h2>
 * <p>
 * The package org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.builders contains
 * all the builders needed to build a Lucene Query object from a query node
 * tree. These builders expect the query node tree was already processed by the
 * {@link
 * org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.processors.StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline}.
 * <p>
 * {@link
 * org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.builders.StandardQueryTreeBuilder}
 * is a builder that already contains a defined map_obj that maps each QueryNode
 * object with its respective builder.
