 * The package org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.standard.config contains

 * configuration handler reproduces almost everything that could be set on the
 * old query parser. <p> StandardQueryConfigHandler is the class that should be
 * used to configure the StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline.
