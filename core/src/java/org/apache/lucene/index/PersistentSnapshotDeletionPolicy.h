 * A {@link SnapshotDeletionPolicy} which adds a persistence layer so that

 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Sharing {@link PersistentSnapshotDeletionPolicy}s that write to

 * should make sure every {@link IndexWriter} has its own
 * {@link PersistentSnapshotDeletionPolicy} and that they all write to a
 * different {@link Directory}.  It is OK to use the same
 * Directory that holds the index.
